Title: Preview colour palettes using pixel art.
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: "Aaron Jacobs <atherie@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: In the spirit of terminal colourscheme display
    scripts, this package provides a small number of functions
    for previewing colour palettes using pixel art. It has
    built-in functionality for working with RColorBrewer, but
    any user-defined colour palettes will work just as well. The
    package is named for the various `invaders.sh` scripts that
    inspired it.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.1.1)
Imports:
    reshape2,
    ggplot2
Suggests:
    data.table,
    RColorBrewer
